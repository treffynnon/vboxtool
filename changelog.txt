Revision:
0.3 [2008-10-16]
  - Added vboxtoolinit for auto start sessions at boot time and auto save sessions when
    host is stopped. Depends on /etc/vboxtool/vboxtool.conf. Structure: 
    vbox_user='<user name>'
    As for now, there's only one option to configure.
  - To achieve naming consistency between package name and names of various parts: 
    - Main script 'vbox' is renamed to 'vboxtool'
    - Config folder is moved from /etc/vbox to /etc/vboxtool

0.2 [2008-10-02]
  - Lines in /etc/vbox/machines.conf can be commented out by '#'
  - Added portforwarding. Structure of /etc/vbox/machines.conf:
    <session name>,<vrdp port>,<host port>-<guest port>|..."
    - as many portpairs as needed, can be added
    - all existing settings under "vboxtool-tcp-<host port>-<guest port>" are considered as
      'property' of VBoxTool and thus removed prior to setting portforwarding, to obtain a clean 
      situation with no orphaned settings.

0.1 [2008-09-23] (modifications not under revision control)
  2008-09-20
  - Help restructured.
  - Option --version|version added.
  2008-09-15
  - Autostart option. Starts all sessions in a predefined configuration file.
  2008-09-10
  - Bug fixed for retrieving pid when sessions are started with the VBoxHeadless command.
    In contrast to the VBoxManage command, VBoxHeadless does not show the session uuid in the
    ps command, while that was imperative because filtering (grep) takes place on that uuid. 
    Solved by filtering on session name; this is less 'secure' as an unique id, but the 
    session name is displayed by both commands so this is the only solution.
    Later this can be replaced by the new 'metrics' command, introduced in 2.0.0, but that means
    the script will only work (for that part at least) for 2.0.0 which is at the moment not desirable.  2008-09-08
  - Bug fixed for trapping multiple instances of VBoxManage. This is the case 
    on rpm-based systems where there are multiple symlinks 'VboxManage'
    - Original line: [ -n $(whereis VBoxManage | awk 'BEGIN{FS="VBoxManage "}{print $2}') ]
    - Changed to:    [ -n $(whereis VBoxManage | awk 'BEGIN{FS=" "}{print $2}') ]

  - Backup a specific session: vbox backup <session name>
    - running sessions are saved and started after backup has completed
    - this is only a first approach: copy complete vdi file
      - this is taking a long time because the complete VDI file has to be copied each and every time
      - this is not a real solution in real production systems
  - Save a specific session: vbox save <session name>
  - Start a specific session: vbox save <session name>
  - Stop all running sessions or a specific session: vbox stop [session name]
  - Renamed option 'showall' to 'show'
  - Code refactoring
  2008-08-19
  - Renamed from vbox-tool to vbox
  - Only show saved session on shutdown
  - Option 'shutdown' changed to 'save' (cause that's what happening)
  - For running sessions, show runtime info: cpu-load and memory 
  - Added option 'showrun': retrieve status of running sessions
  - Added option 'start': start all saved sessions
    - powered off & aborted sessions are left alone
  - Added option 'showall': retrieve status of all sessions
  - No-parameter or incorrect parameter invocation gives usage-page
  - Added option '--help': shows usage
  - Show configured vrdp-port while showing and starting sessions

0.0 (never released under revision control)
  - Initial release
